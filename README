inputs/DYJetsToLL_M-50.root  is an input ntuple. It contains simulation events (270538 events, to be precise).

As the name suggests it is simulation of a specific process,
the Drell-Yan process. Plot dilepton invariant mass to see
what the 50 is.

The main code (which does analysis and fills histograms) is
in the nano9Ana class. This class is declared and described in
nanoAna9.h and nano9Ana.C

ana.C is a driver script.

After all editing is done, we run the code as follows

> root -l

[].L nano9Ana.C+
[].x ana.C(0)

This will produce output files hst_DY.root and sum_DY.txt
